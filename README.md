# dotfiles
A repository for all my .dotfiles

## Stow (linking all the configuration files)
There are two parts to the stow, the stow_config and stow_core. Core is simply all the 'dotfiles' stored in the base home directory `~/`, while the stow_config section is more directed too specific packages, such as tmux or i3

### Core files
-	.xinitrc
-	.gitconfig
-	.tmux.conf
-	.dir_colors

### Packages
-	i3
-	kitty
-	neovim
-	polybar
-	htop
